# Security & Privacy

## Module Overview

Security and privacy are not optional—they're fundamental quality attributes. A single SQL injection vulnerability or GDPR violation can cost millions in damages and destroy user trust. This module covers QA's role in security testing, OWASP Top 10 validation, authentication testing, and privacy compliance.

After completing this module, you will:
✅ Understand QA's role in security testing
✅ Test for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
✅ Validate authentication and authorization
