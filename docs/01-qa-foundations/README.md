# QA Foundations

Core principles and concepts that underpin all quality engineering work.

## Lessons

1. [QA vs QC vs QE](01-qa-vs-qc-vs-qe.md)
2. [Verification vs Validation](02-verification-vs-validation.md)
3. [Test Levels and Test Pyramids](03-test-levels-and-pyramids.md)
4. [Risk-Based Testing](04-risk-based-testing.md)
5. [Test Design Techniques](05-test-design-techniques.md)
6. [Severity vs Priority](06-severity-vs-priority.md)
7. [Traceability and Requirements Coverage](07-traceability-requirements-coverage.md)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will:
- Distinguish between QA, QC, and QE
- Understand verification vs validation
- Apply appropriate test levels
- Use risk-based testing to prioritize work
- Design effective test cases using proven techniques
- Properly classify defects by severity and priority
- Create and maintain requirements traceability

## Prerequisites

Complete [Module 00: Introduction](../00-introduction/)

## Time Estimate

8-10 hours to complete all lessons.

## Practical Application

These concepts form the vocabulary and mental models used daily in QA work. You'll reference these principles when:
- Planning testing for a new feature
- Explaining quality strategy to stakeholders
- Prioritizing testing efforts under time constraints
- Classifying and triaging bugs
- Demonstrating test coverage
