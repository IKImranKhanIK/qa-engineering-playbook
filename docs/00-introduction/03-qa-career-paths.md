### Software to Hardware QA
**Prepare By:**
- Learning electrical/mechanical basics
- Understanding manufacturing processes
- Gaining hands-on hardware exposure
- Studying reliability engineering

**Timeline:** 1-2 years transition

### Generalist to Specialist
**Prepare By:**

- Certifications if applicable
- Building portfolio in that area
- Networking with specialists

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

## What Senior Engineers Know

**Career is not linear.** Lateral moves, skill gaps, and pivots are normal. Your path won't match the idealized progression.

**Titles vary wildly across companies.** "Senior" at a startup may equal "Mid-level" at Google. Focus on skills and impact, not titles.

**Compensation is negotiable.** The best raises come from switching companies. Loyalty is not financially rewarded.

**Network matters.** Most opportunities come from referrals. Invest in relationships.

**Specialization is a trade-off.** Deep specialists earn more but have fewer opportunities. Generalists have more options but less differentiation.

## Exercise

Answer these questions to clarify your career direction:

1. Do you prefer technical depth or breadth?
2. Do you want to manage people or stay technical?
3. Which industry interests you most?
4. What's your 5-year target role?
5. What skills gap exists between current and target?

Write down your answers and create a 12-month learning plan.
