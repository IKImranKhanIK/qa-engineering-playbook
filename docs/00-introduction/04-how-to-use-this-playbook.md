- Write down questions

### 2. Understand, Don't Memorize
- Ask "why" for each concept
- Relate new knowledge to what you already know
- Explain concepts to someone else

### 3. Apply Immediately
- Complete exercises at the end of each lesson
- Practice with labs
- Use templates in real or practice scenarios

### 4. Reflect
- What did you learn?
- What's still unclear?
- How will you use this in your work?

### 5. Repeat
- Review challenging concepts multiple times
- Return to earlier modules as you gain experience
- Connect dots between modules

## Using Templates

### When to Use
- Starting a new project and need structure
- Establishing team standards
- Preparing for interviews (portfolio pieces)

## What Senior Engineers Know

**Playbooks are starting points, not gospel.** Adapt concepts to your context. Real-world scenarios rarely match textbook examples.

**You'll forget details.** That's normal. Focus on understanding principles. You can always look up specifics.

**Learning is continuous.** Completing this playbook doesn't mean you're done. Technology, methodologies, and best practices evolve constantly.

**Theory enables practice.** You need both. Pure theory without application is useless. Pure practice without understanding is fragile.

**Your best teacher is production.** Books and courses provide foundation. Real incidents, customer issues, and production systems teach the hardest lessons.

## Customizing Your Path

### If You're Currently Employed in QA
- Focus on modules that fill your skill gaps
- Apply learnings immediately to your work
- Use your real projects for lab exercises
- Share templates with your team

### If You're Transitioning to QA
- Start with foundations (modules 00-01)
- Build portfolio projects as you learn
- Practice explaining concepts (interview prep)
- Connect with QA professionals for mentorship

### If You're a Student
- Complete labs thoroughly for hands-on experience
- Build a capstone project incorporating multiple modules
- Create portfolio showcasing your work
- Participate in open source QA projects

### If You're a Manager
- Use this to upskill your team
- Identify gaps in your organization's practices
- Adopt templates as team standards
- Contribute your team's learnings back
