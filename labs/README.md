# Hands-On Labs

Practical exercises to reinforce concepts from the curriculum modules.

## How to Use Labs

Each lab includes:
- **Objective**: What you'll learn
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge before starting
- **Setup Instructions**: Tools and environment needed
- **Step-by-Step Exercises**: Guided tasks
- **Expected Outcomes**: What success looks like
- **Evaluation Criteria**: How to assess your work
- **Extensions**: Additional challenges for deeper learning

## Lab Categories

### Software Testing Labs (`/software`)
Web application testing, database testing, and system testing scenarios.

### Automation Labs (`/automation`)
Test automation exercises building frameworks and CI/CD integration.

**Available Labs:**
- [API Testing Lab](automation/api-testing-lab.md) - 3-4 hours, Intermediate
  - Test REST APIs using Postman and Python
  - Practice GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
  - Write automated API tests with pytest
  - Handle authentication and error scenarios

### Hardware Testing Labs (`/hardware`)
