# QA Engineering Playbook

A comprehensive, production-grade guide to Quality Engineering covering software, hardware, and systems testing.

## Overview

This repository is a complete curriculum for Quality Engineering, designed for:

- Beginners entering QA roles
- Experienced testers transitioning to QA Engineer / SDET positions
- Systems and hardware QA engineers
- Engineering teams building quality programs

This is not a collection of blog posts. This is a hands-on engineering playbook with real templates, labs, and workflows used in production environments.

## What You'll Learn

### Software Quality
- Web, API, database, and microservices testing
- Test design techniques and risk-based testing
- CI/CD quality gates and regression strategies
- Exploratory testing methodologies

### Test Automation
- UI and API automation architecture
- Test data management and environment strategies
- Flaky test prevention and debugging
- CI execution, reporting, and maintenance

### Performance & Reliability
- Load, stress, and soak testing
- Observability for QA engineers
- SLO/SLA validation
- Reliability metrics and incident analysis

### Security & Privacy
- QA's role in security validation
- OWASP-based testing approaches
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Privacy test case design

### Mobile QA
- iOS and Android testing strategies
- Device fragmentation handling
- App store readiness validation
- Network and offline testing

### Hardware QA
- EVT/DVT/PVT validation phases
- Manufacturing quality lifecycle
- Environmental and stress testing
- Firmware validation and supplier quality
- Failure analysis and 8D/CAPA processes

### Systems & Integration
- Device + app + backend testing
- Compatibility matrices and versioning
- Interoperability testing
- Field issue analysis

### Release Quality
- Go/No-Go decision frameworks
- Bug triage and prioritization
- Release readiness reviews
- Quality metrics that matter

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Open Directly
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No server required!

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server .

# Using VS Code
Install "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live"
```

### Option 3: Deploy Online
Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for free hosting.
